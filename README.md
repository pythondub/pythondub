Hi, I'm Michael Dub (pythondub).

I am a Python Developer specializing in web scraping, data extraction, Excel automation, and building Telegram bots. 

I work as an AI-Assisted Developer. This means I actively use modern tools like Cursor IDE and LLMs to write clean code faster, avoid common bugs, and focus entirely on solving your business tasks. 

Here is what I can do for you:

- Web Scraping: I extract structured data from both static and dynamic websites using BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and Playwright. I deliver clean Master CSV files and always provide detailed failure logs.
- Excel Automation: I write Python scripts using pandas and openpyxl to automate messy data processing, format sheets, and generate reports.
- Telegram Bots: I build custom bots using aiogram for notifications, automated support, and REST API integrations.

How I work:
I focus on accuracy so the final data or tool is completely ready to use. I can take full ownership of a task from start to finish independently, but I also enjoy working in a team environment. I am comfortable joining group calls, collaborating with project managers, and keeping communication clear in Slack, Discord, or Teams.
